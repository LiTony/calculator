This is a self-learning project where I am testing features in both Python and the PyQT6 Graphical User Interface Library.

The project is a simple calculator to perform addition and subtraction. It implements a clear feature and has a typical number pad format.

Dependencies List:  
> PyQT6 (installable by running "pip install PyQT6")

Below is an image of the program.

Notes:
Uses eval() which is not ideal, however implements the "evaluation" aspect nicely.  
> To address potential user error / self-inflicted issues, I prevent direct input to the areas by setting them as read only.  
> This means that the user has to use pre-programmed buttons (0-9, +/-/=) to access the fields / set input / get output.  

Pipeline:
> Add (haha) multiplication and division  
> Exponentiation  
> Log  
> Direct Keyboard Input  
> Customization Features
